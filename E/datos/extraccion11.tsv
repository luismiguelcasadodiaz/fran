2267	Sweety Ice Cream - Mochi Ice Cream	Booth: N436	['Monterey Park,', 'CA', 'United States']	Sweety mochi ice cream is a traditional Japanese treat, with a Golden State twist. We use farm fresh California milk to craft our creamy, deeply-flavorful ice creams, then bundle them into soft, perfectly chewy rice dough. We believe in simple and quality ingredients like locally sourced rice flour, rBST/rBGH-free milk, non-GMO Matcha powder and Madagascar Vanilla, Alphonso mangoes and Dutch processed cocoa. We never use preservatives, artificial colors, corn syrup or added flavors.	N/A	['Frozen', 'Special Attributes']	[['Ice Cream'], ['Gluten/Wheat Free']]
