At CLP, we offer many items that allow hardline manufacturers to communicate branding and product information including full color stickers, hangtags, and backer cards. We have an in-house art & design team that excels in brand image creativity and finding cost-effective solutions for every budget.

The Afinia L-801 inkjet printer has an 8.5” print width, photo-quality 1600 DPI resolution, and can print at 60 feet/min. Its high-capacity ink tanks hold 1.25 liters of total ink for large runs while its easy access doors provide for fast, simple media and ink replacement. For even more in-plant capability, the Afinia DLP-2000 takes the L-801’s outstanding printing power and adds both die cutting and laminating stations. The RotoMetrics cylinder accepts flexible dies up to 12 inches in length allowing for fast, accurate die cutting of any shape. Both of these models allow manufactures of all types to produce high-quality, full color product labels on demand, all without paying for a single plate.
